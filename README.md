# Book Repository

This is my repo for documenting questions, answers, and notes for books I'm reading to help keep track of questions or learnings I have, as well as for others to read if they're curious about what I've gathered from the books.

You may find some useful books in this repo [here](https://github.com/lafengnan/ebooks-1/tree/master).
